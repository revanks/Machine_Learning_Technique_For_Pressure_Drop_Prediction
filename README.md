## Motivation

- Two-phase pressure drop prediction of refrigerant fluids is very essential in many cooling application. In the past many decades thermal system design engineers solely relied on many empirical and semi-empirical pressure drop models which are developed for specific fluids and narrow range of operating conditions, this makes prediction accuracy poorer.

- In the present study the prediction of two-phase frictional pressure drop of refrigerant fluid R22, R410a, R134a in a horizontal straight pipe during adiabatic wall conditions is made with the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Random Forest Regressor (RFR), and Xtreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBR).

## Methods
- More than 1000+ experimental two-phase pressure drop data is taken from the literature with features- mass flux, vapor quality, pipe diameter, saturation pressure and saturation temperature. 

- Three different ANN, RFR and XGBR models trained with 22 input features to predict output pressure gradient. 

## Conclusion
- Among ANN, RFR, and XGBR, It is concluded that the application of ANN is very powerful tool when it comes to accurate of prediction two-phase thermo-hydraulics of refrigerant pipes.
